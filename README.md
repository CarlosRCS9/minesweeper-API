# minesweeper-API

This project implements a REST API for a minesweeper game in Node.js.

# Client requirements (from most to least important)

- Develop a REST API for the game.
- Document the REST API of the game.
- Develop an API client library for the REST API (ideally in another language than Node.js).
- When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat).
- The game must allow to flag a cell with a question mark.
- The game must allow to flag a cell with a red flag.
- The game must detect when it is over.
- The REST API should provide the persistence of game data.
- The game time must be tracked.
- The games should be able to be saved and resumed.
- The player should be able to select game parameters (rows, columns, and mines).
- The REST API must support multiple users.
